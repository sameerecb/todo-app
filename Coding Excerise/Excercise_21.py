# The get_max function you created in the previous exercise returned 9.7.
# In this exercise, you should:
# 1. change the function so this time it returns the following string:
# "Max: 9.7, Min: 9.2"
# where 9.7 is the maximum, and 9.2 is the minimum.
# Note: For the exercise to be marked as correct by the system, you should return the exact string "Max: 9.7, Min: 9.2"
